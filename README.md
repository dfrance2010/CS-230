Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this project and they asked to design a web-based application for their game, Draw It or Lose It. This involved designing the game architecture using the singleton patterm, evaluating different operating platforms for their strengths and weaknesses, and making recommendations for moving forward.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job in the design and domain model sections. I recognized the value of the singleton pattern in object-orented programming and was able to articulate how the architecture would work.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that having to explain what was happening helped me to better understand the code itself. Knowing how everything fits together is most of the battle, from theere it was just following through.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the recommendations section to include more detail. I think I could have done a better job of making the client confident that my recommendations are the best path forward.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Being unable to talk to the user directly, I frequently consulted the design constraints to make sure I was hitting all of the bullet points. If you don't take care of the user's needs, you haven't succeeded in the project.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used object oriented programming, utilizing the sinlgeton pattern and client-server architecture. The singleton pattern was good in terms of making sure there could only be one instance of a game and the client-server architecture allowed users from different platforms to interact with the game.
